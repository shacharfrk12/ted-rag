  "response": "Talk: \"How web video powers global innovation\" (Chris Anderson)\n\nShort summary of the key idea: Anderson argues that web video is creating a \"Crowd Accelerated Innovation\" — a self‑fueling cycle of learning that democratizes access to knowledge and improves people's lives. As he puts it, \"for the first time in human history, talented students don't have to have their potential and their dreams written out of history by lousy teachers. They can sit two feet in front of the world's finest,\" and TEDTalks are evolving from a one‑to‑many model toward a many‑to‑many model that lets people around the world learn, respond and innovate together. This openness to sharing knowledge is what powers broader social and educational benefit.",
