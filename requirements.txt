# Note: `langchain` removed because the environment previously failed resolving
# `langchain==0.1.124`. This repo includes a local shim `langchain_openai.py` that
# implements the small subset of embeddings/chat used here. If you prefer to use
# `langchain` from PyPI instead, pin a known good version and add it back.
